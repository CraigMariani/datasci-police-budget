## What is this website?
The website displays budget data for cities in the Bay Area, starting with Oakland and San Francisco. Our aim is to make your city's budget easy to view and understand. You pay taxes. We do too. Where does that money go?

## What can I do here?
Many fun things! You can get a good overview of how money is collected and spent in San Francisco. You can practice making your own budget for the city and seeing how spending changes as you increase or decrease categories.
